<h1>Min Yoongi </h1>

<div class="a">
<p align="justify">

He was born on 9th of march 1993 in Daegu, South Korea, into a middle class family.
His family includes both of his parents and his older brother. 
The passion of music was always within him, from the early years of his life. 
The first introduction of music, up close to him, was through learning piano by himself. 
He self-practiced to learn the basics of it, because then, he couldn't afford to pay 
for private piano classes 
due to the economic state of his family. He was also into writing songs, from a very young 
age(since he was in highschool). In his teenage years, he used to sell his songs to others and arrange(produce)songs for others, only to get to afford his daily meals and expenses. 

Except music, his other interests included basketball. 

He was an average teenager, working hard to study and doing multiple part-time jobs(such as food delivery). The only difference is that he didn't give up on his music and on his dreams. And that had lead him to turn into a name, none can ever forget about, in the korean pop music industry and also in the world pop music industry.
